Please use flake and python to develop a simple and responsive landing page using HTML and CSS for my game Chinese Character Block.

Goals:
1. Host it on Vercel as a static site.
2. Include a download button for the `.exe` file hosted either in `/public` folder
3. Include a short description of the game (it’s a Chinese learning game where users learn characters by orienting falling blocks or typing pinyin or constructing idioms).
4. Use a clean and modern style (centered layout, nice font, soft colors, rounded buttons, background for a typical educational language game) similar to webpage_example.png.
5. Make it responsive for both desktop and mobile.
6. Make it work for both Windows and OS operating system.
7. Set up a donation by paypal and connect with my paypal account harrison_lee25@hotmail.com. Hide the paypal email account from the viewers. write something like "Donation less than $5 is welcome".
8. The folder structure should look like:
/public
├── ChineseCharacterBlock.exe
├── Chinese-Character-Block_game_demo.mp4
/index.html
/style.css

Deliverables:
- A full `index.html` file
- A matching `style.css`
- Clear instructions on how to deploy this to Vercel and where to put the `.exe` and `demo.mp4` files
